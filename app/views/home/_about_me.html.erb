                            Hi! I'm Paul Lemus and I like creating things that help people. I began learning <span
                                class="text-red-400">Ruby on
                                Rails</span>
                            so
                            that I could
                            create a better portal for my photography clients, but then realized that I enjoyed coding
                            way
                            more
                            than my photography business.
                            So, <span class="text-green-400">I closed up shop</span> and jumped into the deep end in
                            learning
                            full-stack web development.
                        </p>

                            Now, I'm looking for <span class="text-green-400">a full-time position</span>. I've
                            colloborated with developers for one-time
                            features or consulted on legacy applications.
